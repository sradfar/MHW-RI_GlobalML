# This script reads a dataset containing the time differences (hr_diff) for reaching 
# a 30-knot increase in wind speed and visualizes the distribution of these events 
# over different time spans. It bins the time differences, calculates the frequency 
# of events as percentages, and plots a normalized bar chart.
#
# Outputs:
# - A bar chart showing the normalized percentage of events for each time span 
#   (hours required for a 30-knot increase), which helps in understanding the 
#   forecast lead time of the proposed ML model.
# - The chart is saved as a PDF file titled 'normalized_hr_diff_plot.pdf', suitable 
#   for inclusion in reports or presentations.
#
